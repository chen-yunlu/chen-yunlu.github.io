<p>
Welcome to my homepage!
I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student in <a href="https://statistics.northwestern.edu/">Statistics and Data Science</a> at <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://fengruan.github.io/index.html">Feng Ruan</a>.
</p>



<p>
My research interests lie at the interface of statistics, machine learning, and bioinformatics, with the specific goal of understanding feature learning in neural networks and designing better architectures that balance prediction and interpretation especially for genomics applications.
</p>

<p>
Before joining Northwestern, I received my master's degree in Statistics and bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Data Science at <a href="https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/">Fudan University</a>.
