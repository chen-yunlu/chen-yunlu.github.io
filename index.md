<p>
Welcome to my homepage!
I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in <a href="https://statistics.northwestern.edu/">Statistics and Data Science</a> at <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://fengruan.github.io/index.html">Feng Ruan</a>.
</p>



<p>
My research interests lie broadly at the interface of statistics, machine learning, and optimization. I am now working on inferring the low-dimensional structure of high-dimensional data and developing computationally aware algorithms in nonparametric problems.
</p>

<p>
Before joining Northwestern, I received my master's degree in Statistics and bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Data Science at <a href="https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/">Fudan University</a>.
